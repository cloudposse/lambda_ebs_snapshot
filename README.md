# terraform-aws-ec2-ami-backup [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ec2-ami-backup.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ec2-ami-backup) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ec2-ami-backup.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ec2-ami-backup/releases) [![Slack Community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudposse.com)


This repo contains a terraform module that creates two lambda functions
that will create AMI automatically at regular intervals. It is based on
the code at
<https://serverlesscode.com/post/lambda-schedule-ebs-snapshot-backups/> and
<https://serverlesscode.com/post/lambda-schedule-ebs-snapshot-backups-2/>.


---

This project is part of our comprehensive ["SweetOps"](https://docs.cloudposse.com) approach towards DevOps. 


It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).










## Usage

Include this repository as a module in your existing terraform code:

```hcl
module "lambda_ami_backup" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ec2-ami-backup.git?ref=tags/0.3.2"

  name           = "${var.name}"
  stage          = "${var.stage}"
  namespace      = "${var.namespace}"
  region         = "${var.region}"
  ami_owner      = "${var.ami_owner}"
  instance_id    = "${var.instance_id}"
  retention_days = "14"
}
```




## Examples

Example on excluding some of attached EBS volumes:

```hcl
module "lambda_ami_backup" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ec2-ami-backup.git?ref=tags/0.3.2"

  name           = "${var.name}"
  stage          = "${var.stage}"
  namespace      = "${var.namespace}"
  region         = "${var.region}"
  ami_owner      = "${var.ami_owner}"
  instance_id    = "${var.instance_id}"
  retention_days = "14"

  block_device_mappings = [
    { "DeviceName" = "/dev/xvdf", "NoDevice" = "" },
    { "DeviceName" = "/dev/xvdg", "NoDevice" = "" },
  ]
}
```
